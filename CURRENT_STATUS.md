## 💡 What's Next?

You have **3 paths forward**:

### Option 1: Add New Features
Choose from:
- **Direct Messaging** (UI exists, needs backend)
- **Post Editing** (allow users to edit posts)
- **Image Uploads** (minimal, keep brutalist)
- **User Blocking/Muting** (privacy controls)
- **Notifications UI** (backend events already exist)
- **Groups/Communities** (simple community system)
- **Deeper Threading** (multi-level replies)

### Option 2: Deploy to Production
- Set up Vercel (frontend hosting)
- Set up Railway (backend hosting)
- Configure MongoDB Atlas
- Update environment variables
- Follow `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide

### Option 3: Refine & Optimize
- Add more tests (increase coverage to 100%)
- Optimize database queries (indexes, aggregations)
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Performance profiling
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- SEO optimization (meta tags, Open Graph)
