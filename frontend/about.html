            <h3>What is a Holophrase?</h3>
            <p>
                A <strong>holophrase</strong> is a single word that expresses a complete thought. 
                Think of how a child might say "up!" to mean "pick me up" or "water!" to mean 
                "I want water." It's the essence of communication stripped to its core.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Holophrame embraces this philosophy: meaningful communication without the noise.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
            
            <h4>No Algorithms</h4>
            <p>
                Your feed shows posts in chronological order. Period. We don't decide what 
                you should see based on "engagement" or advertiser interests. You see what's 
                happening now, in the order it happened.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Minimal Data Collection</h4>
            <p>
                We collect only what's necessary: username, email, and password. That's it. 
                No phone numbers. No real names required. No tracking pixels. No selling your data.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Brutalist Design</h4>
            <p>
                Holophrame looks like the web from 1995, and that's intentional. No smooth 
                animations. No hidden navigation. No algorithmic trickery. What you see is 
                exactly what you get.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Text-First Communication</h4>
            <p>
                Posts are limited to 500 characters. This forces clarity and thoughtfulness. 
                We believe in the power of words, not just images and videos competing for 
                attention.
            </p>

            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks</li>
                <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js with Express and MongoDB</li>

            <h3>The Rules</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Be human.</strong> Real people, real thoughts, real conversations.</li>
                <li><strong>Character limit: 500.</strong> Say what matters, nothing more.</li>
                <li><strong>No spam.</strong> Automated posting will get you banned.</li>
                <li><strong>No harassment.</strong> Disagree all you want, but be civil.</li>
                <li><strong>No manipulation.</strong> No fake accounts, no vote brigading, no gaming the system.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Who Built This?</h3>
            
            <p>
                Holophrame was built by developers who remember when the web was weird, 
                wonderful, and human-scale. We're tired of algorithmic feeds, dark patterns, 
                and surveillance capitalism masquerading as "connection."
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This is our attempt to build something different. Something honest.
            </p>
